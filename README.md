### Shield
- Allows you to receive a hit without being destroyed. If a hit is received the shield disappears. If we pick up a shield while under the effect of another shield, we will pick up the item, but no additional effect will be applied.

### Cactus
- Grow randomly on the playing field up to a maximum of 5 simultaneously. Each destroyed cactus will add one point. Upon reaching 20 points, the game will end and the player will be shown the result of the game: the time it took to complete the objective.
